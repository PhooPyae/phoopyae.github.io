      The objective is to prevent spoofing attacks by verifying the liveness of users and contextual information of the images fed to the camera.
      - Developed a challenge-response method to verify user liveness and assess the contextual integrity of images, effectively mitigating spoofing attacks.
      - Used three different datasets of real and fake images and videos; NUAA, Replay Attack Dataset, and collected data of the organization.
      - Proposed a dual-approach system for enhanced security:
      - Patch-Based Approach: Utilized Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for robust feature embedding extraction, creating patches of facial features to feed into a neural network.
      - Depth-Based Approach: Implemented a neural network leveraging facial depth data, providing a complementary layer of user authentication.
      - Led the project from encompassing data acquisition, algorithm development, and comprehensive performance validation.
      - Achieved benchmarked success, with significant loss reductions on multiple datasets: 0.102 on NUAA, 0.14 on an in-house dataset, and 0.2 on the Replay Attack dataset, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed
      methodologies.

#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am an independent researcher specializing in continual learning and meta-learning within the field of Reinforcement Learning (RL). My work focuses on developing algorithms that enable AI systems to adapt and learn continuously in dynamic environments.

I am actively preparing to pursue a Ph.D and I am always open to collaborations and discussions on innovative approaches to continual learning and reinforcement learning.

I worked as a senior data scientist in developing data-driven applications in Carro (Singapore), focusing on regression analysis, object detection, semantic segmentation, and audio analysis.
